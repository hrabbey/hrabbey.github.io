        This is my room.  Many people
would find it pretty boring.  I would have to say I agree.  It's currently
a mess, so there's no picture.  Maybe once I get unpacked completely.

One kind of neat thing is that I hope to have available up to the minute
pictures available.  However, I'm not sure what I'm going to point my 
camera at yet...

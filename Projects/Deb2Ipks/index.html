Here's a list of ipks for the Zaurus I created by repackaging Debian deb files, in order of newest to oldest.  In each zip file is the ipk, a README, and required copyright information.  I believe distributing the ipk alone as might be against the license agreement.

Please report any bugs in the above ipks, perferrably with corresponding fixes to the script files (even if it's just a change in the comments, it helps).  Also, if anyone could confirm if these ipks can be distributed without the copyright info, please let me know.

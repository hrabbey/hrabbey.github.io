  Bugs believed to be fixed, but need confirmation:

v0.02a:
re-did so can install anywhere with one ipk

believe only my system jams upon Qtopia restart with flash mounted.


  Bugs / known problems / desired feature enhancements:

 added in script version 0.02a

if installed to flash, html files not hidded from Documents tab.  
Should I hide them via previous method?  Will do after 2 requests
recieved.

 Based on script version 0.01

pick better directory to put cache in: .hidden/?, a standard opt or
Qtopia?

My lack of knowledge of a correct way to automatically configure
proxy use for all of Qtopia, Opera, Konqueror, and SL-A300's
Sikigami's web browser.  I've got an ugly hack that works for
Opera.  I'd like to understand what changes Proxies.conf on Qtopia
start, and how should I store desired proxy info? With a Common
section it seems to fail to work.

Japanese readers: what's the name of the web browser on the
SL-A300?

Can the ipk be distributed without the copyright info?

Add to init.d script stop & restart options.  Changes needed from
deb's init.d: progs don't exist: install; start-stop-daemon;
isdnctl (but not needed);

A better default web page; smaller and more Zaurus / Qtopia /
Familiar specific

add wwwoffle bookmarks to Opera & etc. / standard page: Cache index
section of Welcome page: http://localhost:8080/index.html#indexes
control pg: http://localhost:8080/control/ & local pages?

?preload w/ Zaurus faq's (esp. Bill's)& info pgs, and monitoring of
?killefiz.

May want other to create ipks for other language versions.  If so,
would be nice to have README and copyright in the appropriate
languages.

maybe create /opt/QtPalmtop/etc/init.d/wwwoffle. Nope, doesn't seem
to do anything.

Debug deb to ipkg conversion script: many other issues in it
identified by keyword "should"

edit conf file so best for average user:
 +post install : remove comments for space?
 +Add option to ignore requests for images / objects, etc. 
 +From z-gen: want opera's ident to be: "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
 MSIE 5.0; Zaurus PDA powered by Linux 2.4.6; 240x320) Opera 5.0
 [en]" ?

more translations of upstream wwwoffle web pages

clean up of deb to ipkg script so easier to maintain and understand

generalize deb to ipkg script so usable for other deb's.

merge deb to ipk script into alien

wwwoffle much too big (600k) according to iPAQ list on
handhelds.org.  Strip its binary size down?  Ways to reduce memory
usage and disk usage?

Improve performance.

#####
  Desired Added Scripts: 

-Add script to download all / most from last time page on Server
(desktop's wwwoffle): wget -proxy... -spider deskip:8080/...
lasttime ...

-online / offline mode automatically via scripts in ??? directory
run-parts'd upon sync.


#####
  A nice Qtopia gui tool might have these features:

-most basic just a Qt frontend to wwwoffle / wget: doable w/
opie-sh.
-online / offline / fetch
-adjust  monitored pages
-purge
-report size of cache and % used, and also relative to storage space
avail. & used, with graphics.
-purge selected file types (i.e. *.jpg, *.gif)
-adjust size of cache immediately, and adjust for future use.
-adjust size to k used / % of disk size / % of space free / k left.
-Adjust config file & reload:
  +adjust size of cache to use
  +Add option to ignore requests for images / objects, etc. 
  +move cache from RAM <=> CF <=> SD <=> custom
-optional task bar applet to go online & fetch / offline
-auto-detect flash removal & insert, and stop & restart wwwoffled

  I'd like to see a comparison review Web page with a 
comparison table of features: 
item, installed size, memory size, ease of setup, ease of use, ..., features
wwwoffle, 
sitescooper (ipk'd for use with <A HREF="http://thommy.myip.org/opie-sh-apps/sitescooper-tips.html">opie-sh browsing</a>), smaller
zepo ( http://www.alterna.tv/zepo/ ), 
wget, built-in
Avant-Go
save as html on desktop: xfer via samba / ftp / etc.,
Other?

Browser options:
Opera
Konqueror
opie-sh
QtReader
links
etc.


Tip for wget / "save as html": make a bookmark for the directory holding the saved html files in the web browser.  Then each saved html folder can be displayed by selecting instead of typing.

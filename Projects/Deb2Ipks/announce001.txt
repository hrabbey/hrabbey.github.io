Subject ANN: WWWOffLe ipk released from .deb

Hello all,

As I promised a while back on IRC, I have made an ipk out of Debian
arm's WWWOffLe. It allows WWW browsing while OFF LinE. It should be
available at: 
http://hrabbey.webhop.net/Projects/Deb2Ipks/

Use wwwoffle_2.5c-10-cf.zip to put the cache on a CF card, and
wwwoffle_2.5c-10-card.zip for a SD card.  Fix my packaging script
to put the cache on internal memory.  It seems to have hiccups upon
restarting qpe after installation, but rebooting seems to clear
everything up.

Now for the details and requests for help.

  Features:
-store browsed pages for viewing on the road.
-monitor pages like news or cartoon sites to be automatically downloaded
-select pages on road to be downloaded later.
-built in simple web server
-can be configured to block advertisements.
-For more info, see WWWOFFLE home-page at:
http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/

  Details of zip / ipk

It takes around 496k internal disk space, <1.4meg on flash, and
1948k RAM|memory.  I've removed some of the documentation, and the
ht:Dig support.  I also removed the ppp and init.d scripts, and
made an overly simple init.d script.  I also made a (buggy, bad)
script to configure Qtopia's proxy.  I added a default local web
page.  I also added a README to the zip file that describes
configuration.

The script / description of what I did are in the file
ipk-frm-deb_wwwoffle.  With it it should be fairly simple to
recreate the ipk.  It requires editing before trying it though.

Please try it out, and let me know of any problems.  Also, if you
can help fix (the many) problems, or with adding features or a Qt
gui, I'd appreciate it.  I've listed below everything I can think
of that could use fixing.  In particular, I'd like to hear from
Konqueror users, sitescooper & Advantgo users, and people familiar
with Familiar's setup.

Enjoy,
Howard Abbey

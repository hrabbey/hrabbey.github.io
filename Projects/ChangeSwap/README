 changeSwap.sh 
  A fairly simple script to quickly adjust swap space 
 on the SL-5000 series Zaurus with out worry of typos.
 Swap space files allow trading internal disk storage 
 space for memory.

 This script gains Qt functionality when 
     opie-sh is installed.
 It is available at: http://www.rit.edu/~tfs1812

 The default Qt action is to toggle between mostly 
      swap space and free internal storage space.
 Usage information is available with the -h option.
 Configuration is currently done by manually 
       editing the script file.
 The default configuration should be acceptable.
 
 Known bugs / ash programming questions 
      are listed in the script file.  None are serious.

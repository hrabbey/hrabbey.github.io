<H1>changeSwap.sh</h1>
<P>
Finally, someone else made a Qtopia Gui interface to do this.  I haven't tested it thouroughly yet, but I'd recommend you give qswap a try before you use my script below.  <A HREF="http://killefiz.de/zaurus/showdetail.php?app=811">Qswap can be found on the Zaurus Software Index Qswap Entry</a>.

Download <A HREF="./changeSwap_0.1.ipk">ipk of <IMG SRC="iconPict.png" WIDTH="64" HEIGHT="64" ALT="Current version"></A>

<P>
  Quickly and easily change free storage space into
 extra swap space, giving more usable memory, 
  and less out of memory errors.

<P>
It can be used from the terminal for flexibility:

or directly from Qt for ease of use:

then: <IMG SRC="./makeSwapOutputPict.png" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="320" ALIGN="top" ALT="output report screenshot">

<H2>The most urgent bug :</h2> A unique, appropriate and cool icon.  (Current icon stolen from <A HREF="http://thommy.myip.org/tmp/">Gonz's filesystem mounter</a> [Sorry Gonz!])  I've had one now for months, but I still haven't gotten around to making a new package.  Sorry.  If anyone wants it, e-mail me and I'll be more likely to get around to it.
<br>
See the script comments for other known bugs.

Current version:
<A HREF="./changeSwap_0.1.ipk">version 0.1</a>, (5/15/2002); includes <A HREF="./changeSwap_V0.1.sh">ash script</a>, and the above icon.  I didn't include the <A HREF="./README">README</a> file, as I do not know an appropriate place for it.
<br>
For the curious, I'll make the <A HREF="./changeSwap.OnHrAbbeysZ.sh">current version on my Zaurus</a> available, although it will probably always be very close to the released version above.

I have found Aaron's brief write up and link to this program, and have mirrored it here as a <A HREF="www.pocketloft.com_phpbb_viewtopic.php_3Ft_3D47+Linux+HOWTO_+Enable+swap+space.html">Description of how to Enable swap space</a>.

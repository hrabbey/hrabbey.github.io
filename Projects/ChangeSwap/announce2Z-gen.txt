Subj: ANN: changeSwap.sh script to add / remove swap file

Hello all,

I've created a fairly simple script to ease making a swap file and
removing it.  For Linux newbies, that is the method to adjust the
internal memory / storage balance on the fly.  The script should be
now available for general consumption at:
http://members.surfbest.net/hrabbey@surfbest.net/Projects/ChangeSwap/

I primarily use it to remove the swap before installing new
programs, and to put it back on the internal storage when done. 
The script saves some typing and arithmetic.

A great big thanks to Thomas "Spiralman" (the creator of opie-sh)
for making the Qt interface possible.  I'd ask that this script be
stuck with Gonz's other useful ones, but think it better be
quarantined till it stabilizes, or gets converted to C++.  The
main thing it still needs to be functional is a good icon.  The
current one is stolen from Gonz's filesystem mounter.  I'd love to
get a few icon submissions from the list.
 
Enjoy,

Howard Abbey

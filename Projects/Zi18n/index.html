Also, syncing the address book with Japanese Microsoft Outlook is reported not to work.  I strongly suspect this is due to Intellisync not changing the character set into UTF.  This could be worked around by converting the xml file with <A HREF="../Deb2Ipks/tcs_1-6.zip">tcs</a>

With the SL-A300's release in Japan (and hopefully it's software's <A HREF="http://k-tai.impress.co.jp/ktai/contents/resource/image/20020624/sharp2s.jpg">world-wide release</a> earlier), all Japanese issues should be resolved.

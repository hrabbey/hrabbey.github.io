        Use at your own risk.  Any information I have is not
official.  It is just my best attempt at the truth.<P>

        Whoever is nice enough to give me the hard disk space to make this 
information available to you was told as little as possible about it, and 
as such should not be held responsible for its contents.  <P>

        If there is a problem with anything I have, please let me 
know quickly, before anyone else sees it.  I will try to correct the problem.  <P>

        I don't think I have anything original enough to be worth 
worring about.  However, if you are worried about it, I might be
mistaken.  If you copy something you think original, say something
like 'found on Howard Abbey's WWW pages', and if you want to be real
nice, tell people how to get here.  But if you forget, don't worry
about it.<P>

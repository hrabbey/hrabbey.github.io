<H3>Mr. Robert Bohnsack of M.T.U.</H3>
Being my Electrical Engineering Advisor, Mr. Bohnsack can attest to 
my academic record.  This would include obtaining nearly an entire 
year's worth of class credits by placement tests.  My record also 
shows my taking advantage of that year by spending my second year 
of schooling in Japan, taking international studies courses at the 
Japan Center for Michigan Universities.  Mr. Bohnsack would also be 
an excellent person to have answer any questions about what my 
E.E. classes would translate to in the work world.

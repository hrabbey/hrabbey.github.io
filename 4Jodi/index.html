<H1>Jodi, my love,</h1>
<P>
I'm making this page as a dumping ground for stuff / data / pictures / etc. that you either ask for, or that I want to give you.  It's not going to be a fancy page, since that would take away time from doing other stuff (such as writing you, or unpacking).
</p>
<H2>So, without further ado, here's some stuff for you:</h2>
<P>
Most of the focus right now is on <A HREF="../Wedding/">stuff for our wedding</a>.</p>
<hr>
<P>
My full <A HREF="./marriageQuotes.txt">collection of quotes on marriage</a>, in case you want to read ahead of where I've gotten to in my e-mails to you.
</p>
<H2>Stuff that I've taken down, due to lack of space:</h2>
<P>
Here is my <A HREF="./JoshuaTree-Spring2002/tripReportOfJtreeSpring2002.html">trip report / write up</a> for a camping and rock climbing trip I took with a long time friend Heather Kauth.  Dennis, another rock climbing friend, who I knew for much less time, backed out a week or two before going, so Heather and I went camping by ourselves.  Aside from the rock climbing and camping part, Heather was also going to her brother's wedding, which I joined as well.  
<P>
The write up is split into two pages: stuff I feel comfortable sharing with everyone, and stuff I wrote for my own recollection.  As a result, the second page is fairly graphic, but straightforward.
</p>
<P>
Looking back at these events, I know many of my actions were wrong (including going on the trip at all without someone else, going to the bachelor / bachelorette party, and drinking to and beyond the point it affected me).  This was written before all that sank in to it's full extent.  However, the story does reflect some of my current weaknesses that I still need to be careful of (inappropriate attraction to women, too much desire to not stick out), and as such I wanted to share it with you.

<P>
Some pictures of me with <A HREF="./FacialExpressions/index.html">differing facial expressions</a>.  As usual, I don't care for any of them.  If you would like a print of one, let me know and I'll send it to you.

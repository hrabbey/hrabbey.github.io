Dear everyone,

Recently some of you received a letter discussing the concept of  
Howards.  I havedecided to propose an extention to that concept.  I  
call it:

            The Organization for Less Precise Speech

I am sure you have noticed that everywhere you go now-a-days someone  
istelling you to use more precise speech.  You know like instead of  
sayingseveral say an exact number and stuff like that.  I think that  
this is allwrong.  Think of all the problems this causes for people.   
Advertisers haveto say exactly what their products do.  Students  
have to know exactly whatthey are saying.  No more BS'ing answer on  
all those essay tests.  Insteadof using nice general terms that  
everyone understands we have to use lots ofcomplex terms that only a  
few people understand.  This brings up anotherpoint.  Because of the  
complexity of what people have to say most peopletoday don't even  
know what they, themselves, are saying so how can theyexpect anyone  
else to understand.  But I have ways to stop this danger toour  
society.

The first step is to institute Howards as our national standard of
measurement since they are by definition inconstant. I think our  
numbersystem should be simplified to one, several, and many; where  
several would bebetween 2 and 10 and many would be over 10.  Ages  
could be simplified toyoung, adult, and senior citizen with the  
divisions between them completelyarbitrary.  I think the sexual  
divisions of he and she are quite unfair andI think that both should  
open for use by anyone of any sex.  

This and many more things must be done.  I ask you to join the  
movement tosave our country from the threat of precise speech.

Sincerely,
Chris "I live many Howards away" Bergstedt

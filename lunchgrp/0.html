Standard Units in the Howard Sytem of Measurment:


Time: Howards.  It is zero Howard when Howard gets up in the morning and
		5oo Howards when he goes to bed.  Breakfast occurs at 100
		Howards, lunch at 200, dinner at 300, and snack at 400.

Distance: Howards.  A length of one Howard is that distance from the feet of
		    Howard to the top of his head.

Velocity: Howards(d)/Howards(t)	Velocity is the distance travelled per unit
				time.  It shall be so.

Accelleration: Howards(d)/Howards(t)SQUARED	Accelleration shall be so.

Actual Velocity in Howards:  Your standard rate of motion in comparison with 
			     that of Howard at a given instance in time.

Actual Accelleration in Howards: 	Your accelleration in comparison with
					that of Howard at a given instance in
					time.

Anger: Howard Roberts

Sanity: Howards.  	There shall be a scale of 10 with the Sanity of 
			Howard being that of 5, or the level of normalcy.

Angular Measurements:  Howards.	The angle that Howard makes in relation to 
				the ground will be a 1 Howard angle.  All 
				other angles can be found in relation to this
				angle.

Engergy: Howards.	The blood sugar level of Howard at any give time shall
			be the new standard from which energy is based.  It 
			SHALL become 1 howard unit of energy.

Heat:	Howards.	Whatever the temperature of Howard in accordance with
			Kelvin at any given time shall be 1 howard.

This is the National Standards listing of Howard Units as of 2-11-94.
Please be informed of new Howard units.

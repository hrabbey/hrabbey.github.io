------I hope this goes through to everyone this time-----------
------If this is your second copy, sue me----------------------

I just wanted to thank you all for dropping by for my little birthday
party last night.  Thanks especially to Adam for sacrificing his  
health to
organize the event, and Chris for providing Adam transportational,
financial, and psychological support.  It was a nice idea, and  
transformed
a sub-par birthday into at least a par one :)

Adam: Don't get any bright ideas about those pictures, pal.

Chad: I know you weren't invited.  (You just kinda barged in, if I  
remember
	correctly).  But any friend of Rush is a friend of mine.

Chris B: the NeXT lab curse: "Only one man in a million has the  
chance to get an A 	in Calculus & Mathematica.  Because you had  
that chance, I think you shall 	suffer more than any man in the  
history of Fisher Hall." 

		This curse is redeemable every Sunday.

Chris S: cica.indiana.edu moved all their PC files to a different  
site.
	Oh yeah, and I was only kidding about you being an April  
fool.  I
	mean, I of course would never infer that your being born on  
April
	1 is in any way ironic or appropriate considering some  
aspects of
	your personality or behavior.  I would never infer such a  
thing.

Dlug: What can I say?  I wouldn't be in Coed without you.  Thanks for
	putting up with me and my 3:00 pushups. I like the poster.

howard: You're the standard by which all party guests will henceforth  
be
	judged.

Jessica: I know you'll be a great escort.

John: I want my "s" back!

Kevin: Thanks for being there.  I wouldn't have felt like myself  
without you.

Korey: "Don't worry, be happy . . . oooooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh  
ooh
	ooh ooh ooh ooh."  You have the talent of being funny without  
even
	trying.  (yes, that is a complement) 


Scott: Happy Birthday to a fellow late nighter.

Vicki: Yeah, you were at my party whether you like it or not!  Hope  
you enjoyed.



let's see, who am I forgetting?

oh, yeah, that big blonde trombone player

BBTB: I haven't forgotten about my poster.  I'll swing by and pick it  
up tonight.  	Then again, you could bring it over when you come to  
get your soap.  			
		HEY EVERYONE, I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO  
ANNOUNCE THAT
		BBTB HAS BEEN SHOWERING WITH LIQUID HAND SOAP FOR THE  
LAST SEVERAL
		WEEKS.  ANYONE INTERESTED IN STARTING A BAR FUND FOR  
HIM PLEASE
		CONTACT ME AT <A HREF="mailto:klbehren@mathlab.mtu.edu">klbehren@mathlab.mtu.edu</A>

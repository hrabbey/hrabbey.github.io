Korey,

I have comments on your system of Howards.
           
-------------------------------------------------
&gt;Standard Units in the Howard Sytem of Measurment:


-&gt;Time: Howards.  It is zero Howard when Howard gets up in the morning and
-&gt;                5oo Howards when he goes to bed.  Breakfast occurs at 100
-&gt;                Howards, lunch at 200, dinner at 300, and snack at 400.

Question, what is the time when Howard is asleep or in this system does that
not exist.

-&gt;Distance: Howards.  A length of one Howard is that distance from the feet
-&gt;                    of Howard to the top of his head.

Looks good to me.

-&gt;Velocity: Howards(d)/Howards(t) Velocity is the distance travelled per unit
-&gt;                                time.  It shall be so.

-&gt;Accelleration: Howards(d)/Howards(t)SQUARED     Accelleration shall be so.

This also looks good.

-&gt;Actual Velocity in Howards:  Your standard rate of motion in comparison
-&gt;                             with that of Howard at a given instance in    
-&gt;                             time.

-&gt;Actual Accelleration in Howards:   Your accelleration in comparison        
-&gt;                                   with that of Howard at a given 
-&gt;                                   instance in time.

I think this should be called your absolute acceleration & velocity relative
to Howard, since in this system Howard is the center of the universe and
everything relative to him is absolute.

-&gt;Anger: Howard Roberts

-&gt;Sanity: Howards.        There shall be a scale of 10 with the Sanity of 
-&gt;                        Howard being that of 5, or the level of normalcy.

Why not?

As I have to go to class now my comments on the rest of the Howard system of
measurement will have to wait until some time in the future.           

-&gt;This is the National Standards listing of Howard Units as of 2-11-94.
-&gt;Please be informed of new Howard units.

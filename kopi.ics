DESCRIPTION:Exp. trackers: compare\, review\, choose\, publish: \nFirst 
 need to get new Zaurus\n\nKey features:\nentry of date\, dollar\, payee\, 
 and optional memo\neasy sync w/Quicekn\, maybe via 
 webconnect\n\nDesirable:\nmulti currency\nreconciling / update 
 balance\nreuse of Quicken's info for quick entry\n\nApp.s that I plan on 
 reviewing and picking from to track\nexpenses\, w/ 1 line review:
 \n\nKapital ($) - keyboard access tricky\, barely usable\, few 
 docs\nStash - base work shows potential\, but very incomplete.\nExpense 
 Tracker - looks usable\, but only records very basics\nKGrok - part of 
 intergrated database suite\, looks like limited categories and no entry 
 assistance\, does allow encryption w/ password\nTodo - lots of manual 
 work\, but usable \nText Editor - pause upon resume makes 
 unusable\nqpe-spreadsheet - with good base file\, probably very 
 usable\nHancom Spreadsheet - ditto \nShop & Save PDA Contest Edition ($): 
 unknown\, shareware w/ liscense.\n--\nWhere I'm coming from:\nI use the 
 keyboard extensively\, as I find it quicker\, and also allows me to use 
 the Zaurus one handed.\nI'm used to HP200lx's Pocket Quicken\nDesired 
 feeatures in order of importance:\nrecord expense: spend / 
 recieve\nrecord date\nrecord category: type of expense / tranfer 
 from\nrecord account: cash / bank / etc. : current accnt.\nrecord 
 payee\nbalance: current & at any time\nrecord check number\neditable list 
 of categories to choose from\nreconcile: find lost money\nrecord memo/ 
 note / description\nautofill date\nrecord currency as part of 
 account?\nautofill payee -> all entries\nrecord location (currently do 
 manually via payee description)\, and adjust default currency (but not 
 interfere w/ simplistic usage)\nrecord time\nshow reports of spending: 
 text\, and pie & line charts\nOther features of HP200lx's Quicken\nsync 
 with GnuCash\ngas mileage calculator: got gas wizard: location\, 
 cost/gal\, final amount\, mileage since last fill up\, autofill gallons\, 
 filled tank checkbox\, mileage\, extras: sizeof tank\, half filled \, % 
 full\nchoose category dialog allows adding category\, and category 
 completion\n---\nALL known:\nNothing reconciles or syncs yet.\nNothing 
 comes with pre-fab categories yet.\nNothing autocompletes entries 
 yet.\n---\nKapital notes:\nslow to start.\nuses own Tkc color 
 scheme\nmakes own tab in launcher.  \nmenu button doesn't work\nTo me\, 
 it's basically a good gui stylus interface to fill in predefined expense 
 fields.  \nIt doesn't show any advantage over Todo in working with those 
 fields once entered.\nPerhaps if I had documentation / a help file I 
 wouldn't hate it so much.  \nFor instance\, I just learned that if you 
 don't fill in the date field\, it autofills it with the current date and 
 time when you exit the expense record entry.\nsearch tool could be good 
 for making reports\ncalendar based expenses could be usefull.\nfollows 
 Qpe document model\nunfortunately\, as a result\, suffers from same pause 
 on resume as text editor.\n---\nExpense Tracker\nrecords category\, 
 expense (auto filled with date) & amount\ncan do all via 
 keyboard\nreports categories above budget.\nsaves in XML file in root 
 directory\nUsage Notes:\ncategories edited in budget 
 tab.\n---\nStash\nmost/ all desired fields there\, but not editable once 
 done\nno balances in preview ver.\nentries not in any order\nstylus 
 needed/ much better\nplans for reconciling\, multiple currencies\npreview 
 version doesn't exit cleanly\n---\nTodo - lots of manual work\, but 
 usable \nfor quick entry\, write new stuff at top.\ncan do all from 
 keyboard\nno extra help via stylus or keyboard\n---\nText Editor\nwith a 
 CF card full of documents\, upon waking from sleep\, it pauses for a few 
 seconds.\n---\n\n

 Jodi likes\, is fast at\, and dislikes/avoids.  At the end of two or 
 three months\, review them with her\, and prepare with her more tasks in 
 her good areas.  Need to make clear when she gets the tasks they they are 
 not strong requests\, just ideas of how she could spend her time.\nAfter 
 2 years\, the tasks set up by her\, she does.  Resists other tasks 
 assigned to me\, or other tasks I've suggested.

DESCRIPTION:Change in my life:\n(by God's request\, Jodi's request\, and 
 my own)\n\nshower in evenings (clean in bed)\ndaily devotions and 
 prayers\ndon't look after other women\nuse lotion so fingertips don't get 
 rough\, esp. thumbs\nclean up living area\ndon't sleep in same room as 
 computer\ntrack expenses in Quicken / other easy program\ndon't stay 
 logged in on computer\nbecome an Initiator: 1st to do things in 
 relationship\, such as e-mail\, say hi\, start dating\, propose\, 
 etc.\nactive ministry\n\nEncourage / Help change in Jodi's life (only by 
 God\, not by me):\near cleaning (doesn't like to get insides 
 wet)\nstopping behind stop signs\nthriftiness\ncoppassionate love for 
 irritating people\ndoctrine of all sins equivalent for 
 non-believers\nidea that those who haven't heard of Christ are judged 
 differently (as she knows) but the result is the same since no one has a 
 spotless conscience\n\nUnimportant things can't change in me:\nethnicity: 
 at least half Romainian father (and name?) desired for any child of Jodi. 
  Falcusan is a Romanian name\ngood vision: good genes desired for any 
 child of Jodi.\n---\nJodi wants changed in me:\n12/5:\nI need to pay 
 attention when I wash off my dishes if a food item in the \nkitchen needs 
 to be put away. I should be responisble for kitchen items\nI need to try 
 to remember to eat all of my meal.\nBe more responsible. examples: 
 bathroom cleanliness\, putting things away\, \nbeing home when I say I 
 will.\nMemory problems. She blames my parents [implied\, my parent's 
 smoking]\, but \nshe's confident it could be reduced / improved. Perhaps 
 its a tumor. Perhaps \ndrugs would help. Examples: home on time\, 
 salad\nshe mentioned counseling to see if that would help me learn. Maybe 
 if it is a \nmental neurological disorder\, drugs may help.\nshe feels I 
 often act first and think later ?like Peter?.\n[My feelings]\nIt has been 
 mentioned in Sunday school that women should give up on trying to 
 \nchange their husbands. Only God can. I pray to God that he changes me 
 in the \nways Jodi desires (and perhaps also in ways she needs).\nIf we 
 go to counseling\, they may try to get Jodi to be less demanding.\nI feel 
 like I am doing a poor job of leading. Maybe study the \"King\" pillar 
 \nof the book more.\nI try to be an obiedent husband\, meeting her 
 requests.\nI have heard if one side always gives\, that side will turn 
 bitter. I've also \nheard it's not up to me to change her. I want to 
 improve in ways she suggests. \nThey are for most part good suggestions\, 
 and somewhat achievable\, with work.\nI feel work drains me (or least 
 like that may be a plausible excuse).\nOur sex life is mediocre. The 
 blame rests on me. I don't perform. I don't \narouse. I feel that is in 
 part due to two items. Percieved dirtyness of \ngenitals\, and rushed due 
 to full bladder for health reasons.\nPlan:\ntry to remember: \nbe home on 
 time or call 1.5 hours ahead.\ndo things immediately when asked / 
 implied\; dont trust will remember.\n12/6\, when asked re 
 leadership\ntake responsibility. remember to clean up kitchen on Jodi's 
 day off (I now \nunderstand why I was supposed to put salad away.] \nIt 
 makes her insecure when I ask her to remind her of things. She only has 
 \nenough memory for one person.\nPay bills on time\nMy notes:\ndidn't 
 delegate bills\, and sounds like she doesn't want that 
 responsibility.\ncan ask for help with remembering things\, one of the 
 main weaknesses she's \npointed out that she doesn't like in me.\nI feel 
 like I could become the stereotypical henpecked\, sad\, husband. \"Yes\, 
 \ndear.\"\nNot becoming a teetotaler was my chance out.

 reviewing and picking from to track\nexpenses\, w/ 1 line review:
 \n\nKapital ($) - keyboard access tricky\, barely usable\, few 
 docs\nStash - base work shows potential\, but very incomplete.\nExpense 
 Tracker - looks usable\, but only records very basics\nKGrok - part of 
 intergrated database suite\, looks like limited categories and no entry 
 assistance\, does allow encryption w/ password\nTodo - lots of manual 
 work\, but usable \nText Editor - pause upon resume makes 
 unusable\nqpe-spreadsheet - with good base file\, probably very 
 usable\nHancom Spreadsheet - ditto \nShop & Save PDA Contest Edition ($): 
 unknown\, shareware w/ liscense.\n--\nWhere I'm coming from:\nI use the 
 keyboard extensively\, as I find it quicker\, and also allows me to use 
 the Zaurus one handed.\nI'm used to HP200lx's Pocket Quicken\nDesired 
 feeatures in order of importance:\nrecord expense: spend / 
 recieve\nrecord date\nrecord category: type of expense / tranfer 
 from\nrecord account: cash / bank / etc. : current accnt.\nrecord 
 payee\nbalance: current & at any time\nrecord check number\neditable list 
 of categories to choose from\nreconcile: find lost money\nrecord memo/ 
 note / description\nautofill date\nrecord currency as part of 
 account?\nautofill payee -> all entries\nrecord location (currently do 
 manually via payee description)\, and adjust default currency (but not 
 interfere w/ simplistic usage)\nrecord time\nshow reports of spending: 
 text\, and pie & line charts\nOther features of HP200lx's Quicken\nsync 
 with GnuCash\ngas mileage calculator: got gas wizard: location\, 
 cost/gal\, final amount\, mileage since last fill up\, autofill gallons\, 
 filled tank checkbox\, mileage\, extras: sizeof tank\, half filled \, % 
 full\nchoose category dialog allows adding category\, and category 
 completion\n---\nALL known:\nNothing reconciles or syncs yet.\nNothing 
 comes with pre-fab categories yet.\nNothing autocompletes entries 
 yet.\n---\nKapital notes:\nslow to start.\nuses own Tkc color 
 scheme\nmakes own tab in launcher.  \nmenu button doesn't work\nTo me\, 
 it's basically a good gui stylus interface to fill in predefined expense 
 fields.  \nIt doesn't show any advantage over Todo in working with those 
 fields once entered.\nPerhaps if I had documentation / a help file I 
 wouldn't hate it so much.  \nFor instance\, I just learned that if you 
 don't fill in the date field\, it autofills it with the current date and 
 time when you exit the expense record entry.\nsearch tool could be good 
 for making reports\ncalendar based expenses could be usefull.\nfollows 
 Qpe document model\nunfortunately\, as a result\, suffers from same pause 
 on resume as text editor.\n---\nExpense Tracker\nrecords category\, 
 expense (auto filled with date) & amount\ncan do all via 
 keyboard\nreports categories above budget.\nsaves in XML file in root 
 directory\nUsage Notes:\ncategories edited in budget 
 tab.\n---\nStash\nmost/ all desired fields there\, but not editable once 
 done\nno balances in preview ver.\nentries not in any order\nstylus 
 needed/ much better\nplans for reconciling\, multiple currencies\npreview 
 version doesn't exit cleanly\n---\nTodo - lots of manual work\, but 
 usable \nfor quick entry\, write new stuff at top.\ncan do all from 
 keyboard\nno extra help via stylus or keyboard\n---\nText Editor\nwith a 
 CF card full of documents\, upon waking from sleep\, it pauses for a few 
 seconds.\n---\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Change in my life:\n(by God's request\, Jodi's request\, and 
 my own)\n\nshower in evenings (clean in bed)\ndaily devotions and 
 prayers\ndon't look after other women\nuse lotion so fingertips don't get 
 rough\, esp. thumbs\nclean up living area\ndon't sleep in same room as 
 computer\ntrack expenses in Quicken / other easy program\ndon't stay 
 logged in on computer\nbecome an Initiator: 1st to do things in 
 relationship\, such as e-mail\, say hi\, start dating\, propose\, 
 etc.\nactive ministry\n\nEncourage / Help change in Jodi's life (only by 
 God\, not by me):\near cleaning (doesn't like to get insides 
 wet)\nstopping behind stop signs\nthriftiness\ncoppassionate love for 
 irritating people\ndoctrine of all sins equivalent for 
 non-believers\nidea that those who haven't heard of Christ are judged 
 differently (as she knows) but the result is the same since no one has a 
 spotless conscience\n\nUnimportant things can't change in me:\nethnicity: 
 at least half Romainian father (and name?) desired for any child of Jodi. 
  Falcusan is a Romanian name\ngood vision: good genes desired for any 
 child of Jodi.\n---\nJodi wants changed in me:\n12/5:\nI need to pay 
 attention when I wash off my dishes if a food item in the \nkitchen needs 
 to be put away. I should be responisble for kitchen items\nI need to try 
 to remember to eat all of my meal.\nBe more responsible. examples: 
 bathroom cleanliness\, putting things away\, \nbeing home when I say I 
 will.\nMemory problems. She blames my parents [implied\, my parent's 
 smoking]\, but \nshe's confident it could be reduced / improved. Perhaps 
 its a tumor. Perhaps \ndrugs would help. Examples: home on time\, 
 salad\nshe mentioned counseling to see if that would help me learn. Maybe 
 if it is a \nmental neurological disorder\, drugs may help.\nshe feels I 
 often act first and think later ?like Peter?.\n[My feelings]\nIt has been 
 mentioned in Sunday school that women should give up on trying to 
 \nchange their husbands. Only God can. I pray to God that he changes me 
 in the \nways Jodi desires (and perhaps also in ways she needs).\nIf we 
 go to counseling\, they may try to get Jodi to be less demanding.\nI feel 
 like I am doing a poor job of leading. Maybe study the \"King\" pillar 
 \nof the book more.\nI try to be an obiedent husband\, meeting her 
 requests.\nI have heard if one side always gives\, that side will turn 
 bitter. I've also \nheard it's not up to me to change her. I want to 
 improve in ways she suggests. \nThey are for most part good suggestions\, 
 and somewhat achievable\, with work.\nI feel work drains me (or least 
 like that may be a plausible excuse).\nOur sex life is mediocre. The 
 blame rests on me. I don't perform. I don't \narouse. I feel that is in 
 part due to two items. Percieved dirtyness of \ngenitals\, and rushed due 
 to full bladder for health reasons.\nPlan:\ntry to remember: \nbe home on 
 time or call 1.5 hours ahead.\ndo things immediately when asked / 
 implied\; dont trust will remember.\n12/6\, when asked re 
 leadership\ntake responsibility. remember to clean up kitchen on Jodi's 
 day off (I now \nunderstand why I was supposed to put salad away.] \nIt 
 makes her insecure when I ask her to remind her of things. She only has 
 \nenough memory for one person.\nPay bills on time\nMy notes:\ndidn't 
 delegate bills\, and sounds like she doesn't want that 
 responsibility.\ncan ask for help with remembering things\, one of the 
 main weaknesses she's \npointed out that she doesn't like in me.\nI feel 
 like I could become the stereotypical henpecked\, sad\, husband. \"Yes\, 
 \ndear.\"\nNot becoming a teetotaler was my chance out.

DESCRIPTION:After having overclocked long times on previous occasions\, 
 and while overclocking for about 45 minutes while charging the battery\, 
 I read that for the C700\, safe overclocking time limits are:\nnormal: 
 15min\ncharging: 7min\n\nNo wonder my Z was crashing on me...  It felt 
 awfully warm...\nSeems fine now that it's cool.  No telling what has been 
 internally stressed though.

  In my case, my ancestral home is no longer permanent.  I 
am no longer likely to be reachable there.  My parents died in their early 80s.  
Since my grandfather built it, my father 
was born in it, and things from three generations have been 
accumulated in it, it is likely to take a while to clear out.  <P>

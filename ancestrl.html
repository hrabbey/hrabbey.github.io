  In my case, permanent is <STRONG>very</STRONG> permanent.  At a minimum, I 
will be reachable there until my parents (currently in their early
60's) pass away.  However, since my grandfather built it, my father 
was born in it, and things from three generations have been 
accumulated in it, it is likely to be my life-long residence.  <P>

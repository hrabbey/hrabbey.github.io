Notes on possible inprovments to resume:
How can I emphasize IBM over NEC? Should I? Yes.  And now that worked at IBM longer, easy to do.
Make NEC's location more obvious (tokyo)

For paper based version:
drop credits obtained
no open faced bullets, nor square (o)
Try to reduce to one page.
If more than one page, my name should be the first thing on each page.

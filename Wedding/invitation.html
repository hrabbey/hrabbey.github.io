<!-- Favorite evangelistic verse?  A typical wedding one for now -->
<!-- from Jewish Bible translation may be preferred -->
Ruth answered 
<br>
&quot;Please don't tell me to leave you 
<br>
and return home!  I will go where you go, 
<br>
I will live where you live; your people will be my people, 
<br>
your God will be my God.&quot;

Ruth 1:16 (CEV)
<!-- 
Ruth 3:11 seemed nice, but reading it in CEV knocked me back into understanding that it would just be a praise to my fiancee, not a praise to God, and a realization of the committment to serve Him together.

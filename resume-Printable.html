Notes on possible inprovments to resume:
How can I emphasize IBM over NEC? Should I? Yes.  And now that worked at IBM longer, easy to do.
Make NEC's location more obvious (tokyo)

For paper based version:
drop credits obtained
no open faced bullets, nor square (o)
Try to reduce to one page?  Or expand to 2 full pages.
If more than one page, my name should be the first thing on each page?

 
Employers are looking for:

In a recent NACE survey, employers rated 
communication skills, 
motivation/initiative,
teamwork and 
leadership skills 
as the top four personal qualities they seek in job candidates.
A high GPA ranked fifth on their list.

Asked to rate the importance of certain skills in new employees, employers 
rated 
interpersonal skills highest 
(4.54 on a five-point scale, where 1=not at all important and 5=very important). 
Next were 
teamwork and 
verbal communication skills (both at 4.51),
analytical skills ( 4.24), 
computer skills (4.12), 
written communication skills (4.11), and
leadership abilities (3.94).

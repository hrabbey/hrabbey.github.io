I hope your year has been a good one.  This fall I finally finished up at Michigan Tech, never to return as as student.  My new job with Western Digital making hard drives has been good so far.  I hope to move into my own apartment after New Year's, but for now I'm enjoying staying at a friend's.  I'll be glad though with things calm down a bit, and I can set up my computer again.  I pray all is well with you.

Take care,

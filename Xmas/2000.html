But an angel said to them, "Do not be afraid.  I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.  This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."  Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests" <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+2:10-2:14&language=english&version=NIV">Luke 2:10 - Luke 2:14</a>

Once again, I hope your year has been a good one.  
As you can see from the pictures, my town of Burlington is nearly as nice in the winter as it is in the summer.   I am glad to see real snow again.  All in all, Burlington is a good town to live in.  I like the mix of tourism and college life that is here.  I have grown to like the public transportation as well, and the people I have met on it.
My job with IBM hard disk parts in Vermont is still very enjoyable, but is filled with the uncertain future all too common in the high tech industry.  I greatly enjoyed the chance it gave me to visit Japan again, and meet with friends there.
I hope all is well with you, and that your holiday season is a restful and joyous one.

        Shared with Ahmed Al-Kaabi, this is my room.  Many people
would find it pretty boring.  I would have to say I agree.  However,
it is part of MTU's International House, which is pretty cool.

One kind of neat thing is that I hope to have available up to the minute
pictures available.  However, I'm not sure what I'm going to point my 
camera at yet...
